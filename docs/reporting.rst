Reporting bugs
==============

Please, report a new bug or a feature request on Bugzilla_ against the anaconda
component. You can use one of the quick links for Fedora_ or RHEL_.

For the bug report, attach logs from the installation. You can find them during the
installation at ``/tmp/*log`` or on the installed system at ``/var/log/anaconda/*log``.
These files are usually essential for the investigation.
